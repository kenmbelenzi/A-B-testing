Timing plays a significant role in your marketing campaign’s results, whether it’s a time of day, day of the week, or month of the year. If you were to run Version A during one month and Version B a month later, how would you know whether the performance change was caused by the different designs or the different months? When you run A/B tests, you’ll need to run the two variations at the same time, otherwise, you may be left second-guessing your results.
